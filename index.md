## mindy's bizarre attempt at making an online playlist

hi Patrick. first off, happy birthday!! <3 <3 I originally put the playlist on 8tracks, but then realized that I didn't like how it shuffled the songs randomly and had ads. I wanted your listening experience to be as **authentic** as possible! don't worry, I didn't just buy a domain name _just_ for this purpose. I bought this a while ago, but never went through the whole process of setting up a website. But you finally gave me a good excuse to! :)
